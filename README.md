This project demonstrates how to use AWS STS with Assume Role from AWS-SDK-Swift.

You will have to work on your AWS side as well, I wrote some note how to setup AWS side on Qiita in Japanese.
There are uncountable try and errors to come to this result, so the document may not be acculate or not sufficent enough for your use case or environemnt.
